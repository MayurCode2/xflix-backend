## Step 1: Project Setup
1. Create a new Node.js project folder.
2. Initialize the project using `npm init` and follow the prompts.
3. Install the required packages: `express`, `mongoose`, and any other necessary packages using `npm install`.

## Step 2: Create the Express Server
1. Create an `index.js` file as the entry point of your application.
2. Import `express` and set up the server.
3. Define your middleware, such as parsing JSON and handling CORS.

## Step 3: Define and Implement API Routes
1. Create a `routes` folder to organize your route handlers.
2. Inside the `routes` folder, create a file for each API version (e.g., `v1Routes.js`).
3. Define route handlers for each of the specified endpoints (`GET /v1/videos`, `GET /v1/videos/:videoId`, `POST /v1/videos`, `PATCH /v1/videos/:videoId/votes`, `PATCH /v1/videos/:videoId/views`).

## Step 4: Set Up MongoDB
1. Create a `models` folder to store your data models.
2. Define a Mongoose schema for your video data, including fields like title, genres, content rating, upload date, and view count.
3. Create a Mongoose model based on the schema.

## Step 5: Implement API Logic and MongoDB Integration
1. Inside the route handlers, implement the logic to interact with the MongoDB database using Mongoose methods.
2. For `GET` endpoints, retrieve data from the database and respond with the appropriate JSON.
3. For `POST` and `PATCH` endpoints, process incoming data, perform necessary updates or inserts in the database, and respond with the appropriate JSON.

## Step 6: Improve `GET /v1/videos` Endpoint
1. Enhance the `GET /v1/videos` endpoint to support query parameters for video title search, genre filtering, and content rating filtering.
2. Implement sorting based on video upload date or view count, as specified.

## Step 7: Connect Backend to Frontend
1. Integrate your backend API routes with the XFlix frontend application.
2. Update frontend API calls to use the appropriate backend endpoints.

## Step 8: Test with Postman
1. Use Postman to test your APIs individually.
2. Test various scenarios, including creating videos, updating votes and views, filtering, and sorting.

## Step 9: Create GitHub Repository and README
1. Create a GitHub repository for your project.
2. Add your project files to the repository.
3. Create a `README.md` file that explains the project, provides API documentation, includes instructions for setting up the project locally, and outlines how to deploy the full-stack application.

## Step 10: Deploy Full-Stack Application
1. Choose a hosting platform for both the backend and frontend (e.g., Heroku for backend, Netlify/Vercel for frontend).
2. Follow the deployment guides for each platform to deploy your full-stack application.

Remember, this is a high-level overview, and each step involves detailed implementation. Make sure to consult the official documentation for Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and any other libraries you use, for in-depth instructions on implementation details. Additionally, adapt and customize the steps according to your project's specific requirements.
